# Go Style

- All Golang code must be idiomatic, efficient, and extremely human-readable.
- All functions must be documented with comments in an idiomatic manner and in English.
- You should not include redundant comments inside functions because the code is expected to be self-explanatory.
- Avoid using pointers whenever possible.
- Always run **ALL** the tests and linter on every change you made using `task test` and `task lint`.

## How to run the tests?

To run the tests use the `task test` command, literally.

## How to run the linter?

To run the linter use the `task lint` command, literally.

## Other important rules to follow

- Use `any` instead of `interface{}` whenever possible.
- Use the new syntax `for i := range 10` instead of `for i := 1; i < 10; i++` whenever possible.
