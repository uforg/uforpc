# Pieces

This folder contains a set of "Pieces" that serve as pre-tested code components
for the code generator.

## What Are Pieces?

Pieces are thoroughly tested, production-ready code snippets that are directly
embedded into the generated code during the code generation process. Unlike
typical code templates, these are fully functional, pre-validated components
that have already undergone comprehensive unit testing.

## Purpose

Pieces serve a critical purpose in code generation:

1. **Pre-Tested Components** - Complex logic is developed and thoroughly tested
   in isolation
2. **Reliability** - Once validated, these components can be safely included in
   generated code
3. **Efficiency** - No need to test these components within each generated
   codebase
4. **Consistency** - The same tested implementation is used across all generated
   outputs

## How Pieces Work

The Pieces approach works by:

1. Developing complex functionality with comprehensive tests
2. Thoroughly validating these components in isolation
3. Storing the verified code in this directory structure
4. Directly embedding these components into the generated output

The code generator embeds these pre-tested implementations verbatim into the
generated code, eliminating the need to recreate complex logic from scratch.

## Benefits

This approach provides several advantages:

- **Higher Quality** - Critical components receive focused testing before
  inclusion
- **Reduced Testing Burden** - No need to test these parts within the generated
  code
- **Simplified Development** - Complex logic can be developed and debugged
  separately
- **Easier Maintenance** - Updates to these components can be made and tested in
  isolation

By maintaining a library of Pieces, you create a collection of reliable code
components that can be confidently included in your generated code across
multiple target languages.
